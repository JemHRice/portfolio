    "The two models aren't quite capable of getting similar results yet - similar results being generating a slogan from a seed industry, and classifying it back to this seed industry. This likely comes from a combination of an undertrained generator model, and an overfitted classification model. The generated slogan is not quite a coherent sentence, and the staunch difference between trianing and test accuracy is alarming for the classifcation model. Some changes that could be made are to use more epochs, a learning rate schedule, and more powerfully, some more advanced LSTM architecture with different unit sizes and embedded layer sizes.\n",

    "The failures of the test speak to the difficulties of other encode-decoding machines, which need to generate outputs of seed information and translate them back. Without proper training, and attention to hyperparameters, these systems do not work. In cases such as this one, the words generated from an industry seed text would have severe overlap with lots of other industries, hence the confusion. For a language translator, different words have similar meanings, and similar words have different meanings, leading to discrepancies across the board."
