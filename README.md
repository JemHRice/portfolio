## 💡 About Me

My path into data wasn’t linear — after starting a degree in Architecture, I moved into an Operations Manager role at Springwood Basketball, where my responsibilities quickly evolved into data-driven planning, optimisation, and decision-making. I spent years deep-diving into player data, building complex Excel models, and designing scheduling, structural, and costing solutions within tight space and budget constraints. Those experiences showed me that my real strength and interest lie in data-driven problem solving, not just operations. Since then, I’ve been deliberately building technical depth through formal data science training, with the goal of applying analytics and machine learning to solve meaningful business problems and drive real-world impact.
